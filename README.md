# SudokuWebgame

This is a project consisiting of a basic sudoku game playable in your web browser. As of the current commit, the game has essential sudoku functionality and
some basic styling utilizing standard css as well as the bulma framework.

Overall the project contains:
  - HTML files for the main sudoku game, as well as a high scores page
    - While some content is built manually in the HTML documents, most is dynamically created in the scripts (ie the game board itself)
  - A CSS stylesheet containing the styles for the whole project 
  - Javascript files that dynamically build the webpage and define functionality (event handling, window loading etc.)

Future Additions:
  - Main page:
    - Timer tracking the game duration, accompanied by a button to start the timer (or automatically start when first cell is clicked)
    - Stylized heading
    - Button on navigation menu specifying dark mode which will utilize a new stylesheet 
  - High - score page:
    - Expand the high score table to contain names of participants and a ranking system
    - some sort of dynamic storage of user scores
    - Stylized heading
  - Adding an about page 

HOW TO RUN:
  - Within VsCode, install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey
  - Have the Main.html file open
  - Either:
    - Right click anywhere on the file and select "Open with Live Server"
    - Select the "Go Live" button located at the bottom right corner of the VsCode interface
